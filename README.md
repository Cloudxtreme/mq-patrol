# mq-patrol
A static-html wiki built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

This website was originally on a CMS, but has since been converted to static files for cheaper/easier hosting. It was initially created with Hugo version 0.16, but has since been minimally updated to suit Hugo version 0.21. Thus if you are looking over the Hugo relevant code, some of the setup may not be optimal by current standards.

The Hugo code can be found in the `archetypes` and `layouts` folders, along with the data used by Hugo in the `content` and `static` folders. The Hugo config has been adjusted to output the static website to the `docs` folder, which is compatible for hosting via Github Pages.

FYI, the website in question is a wiki for the [160 Nissan Patrol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan_Patrol#160) produced from 1980, and it can be viewed at [MQ-Patrol.com](www.mq-patrol.com)
